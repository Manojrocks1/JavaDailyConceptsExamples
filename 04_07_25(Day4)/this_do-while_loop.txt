                                        Concept 1: "this" Keyword

🔸 What is it?
The this keyword refers to the current object inside a class.

🌍 Real-World Analogy:
Imagine you're in a group of people with the same name. You say "this Manoj" 
while pointing to yourself — that's how Java distinguishes between class variables
 and parameters.

Ex:
Code(java):

   class Student {
    String name;

    // Constructor with same name as instance variable
    Student(String name) {
        this.name = name;  // 'this.name' refers to the instance variable
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Student name: " + name);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student("Priyank");
        s.display();
    }
}

o/p:
     Student name: Priyank

                                               Concept 2: "do-while" Loop
🔸 What is it?
A "do-while" loop is similar to a while loop, "but it runs at least once" even if the condition is false.

🌍 Real-World Analogy:
You try a new food at least once before deciding if you like it or not.

🧑‍💻 Example:

 Code(java):
     public class JavaDoWhileLoop {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		// Declare and initialize an integer variable 'i' with the value 5.
		int i = 5;

		// Start of the do-while loop.
		// The code inside the 'do' block will execute at least once,
		// regardless of the condition.
		do {
			// Print the current value of 'i' to the console.
			System.out.println(i);

			// Increment the value of 'i' by 1.
			i++;
		}
		// The loop continues as long as the value of 'i' is less than or equal to 10.
		// After each iteration, the condition is checked.
		while (i <= 10);
	}
}
