                                     ✅ Concept 1: final Keyword
🔸 What is final?
The final keyword is used to "declare constants" or to "prevent changes to variables, methods, or classes".

A final variable = constant value (cannot be reassigned)

A final method = cannot be overridden

A final class = cannot be subclassed

🌍 Real-World Analogy:
Your date of birth is final — it doesn’t change once assigned.

🧑‍💻 Java Example:
Code(java):

public class Constants {
    final int MAX_USERS = 100;

    void showLimit() {
        System.out.println("Max users allowed: " + MAX_USERS);
    }
}
🧠 Output:

bash

Max users allowed: 100
Trying to reassign MAX_USERS will cause a compile-time error.

                                         ✅ Concept 2: continue Statement
🔸 What is continue?
The continue statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next one in a loop.

🌍 Real-World Analogy:
Imagine you’re reading 10 emails and want to skip spam emails. 
->When you see spam, you skip it and move to the next.

🧑‍💻 Java Example:
Code(java):

public class ContinueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            if (i == 3) {
                continue;  // Skip when i is 3
            }
            System.out.println("Value: " + i);
        }
    }
}
🧠 Output:

Value: 1
Value: 2
Value: 4
Value: 5
