                                             ✅ Concept 1: Constructor
🔸 What is a Constructor?
->A constructor is a "special method" used to initialize objects when they are created.
->It has the same name as the class and no return type.

🌍 Real-World Analogy:
When you buy a new mobile, it comes pre-loaded with settings — 
 the constructor is like that setup process.

🧑‍💻 Java Example:
Code(java):

public class StudentConstructor {
    String name;
    int age;

    StudentConstructor(String n, int a){
        name = n;
        age = a;
    }

    void display(){
        System.out.println(name + " is " + age + " years old.");
    }
}

Code(java):

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StudentConstructor s = new StudentConstructor("Akhil", 26);
        s.display();
    }
}

🧠 Output:

Akhil is 26 years old.

                                     ✅ Concept 2: this Keyword
🔸 What is this?
The this keyword refers to the current object. It is used to:

Differentiate between instance variables and parameters

Call another constructor from a constructor

🌍 Real-World Analogy:
Think of "this house" – it refers to the house you’re currently in. In Java, this refers to the current object.

🧑‍💻 Java Example:
Code(java):
public class Car {
    String brand;

    Car(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;  // this.brand refers to instance variable
    }

    void showBrand() {
        System.out.println("Brand: " + this.brand);
    }
}

Main.java:
    public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // StudentConstructor s = new StudentConstructor("Akhil", 26); 
        Car s1 = new Car("Mustang");
        // s.display(); 
        s1.showBrand();
    }
}

o/p:
    Brand: Mustang
